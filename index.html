	<li><h3 style="color: maroon">Most of people nowadays knows when people talk about Online Education especially people who are involve in this new learning.</h3></li></ul>

	<ul><li>
	<h3> The Covid-19 pandemic has pushed schools, higher education institutions (HEIs) or University and training providers online to ensure that effective learning continues. While technology can facilitate seamless migration of face-to-face learning to a virtual platform, accessibility to quality digital content is crucial especially during the movement control order (MCO).

	<h3 style="color: maroon">After doing research and create an agreement, <abbr title="Universiti Teknologi MARA">UiTM</abbr> Vice Canselor has informed lecturers and students to moved all classes to open and distance learning (ODL) mode effective April 13 until the end of the semester for all its campuses nationwide.</h3></li></ul>

	<h3 style="color: maroon">To stay motivated in online education students may need some good step of motivation. There are some ways or tips that I follow to stay motivated when study online :	
	</h3>
	<ol>
		<li><strong>Plan My Schedule</strong></li>
		<ul>
		<li><p>First of all, I will create a schedule for myself. I called it's as a planner that writed on a paper and put it on wall. Usually I do the planner for 2 week or one month.</p></li>
		<li><p>I will make sure I follow the schedule or planner I created. </p></li></ul>
		
		<li><strong>Find Best Study Space</strong></li>
		<ul>
		<li>
		<p> Try to find or create space where we can study will help foster good work habits and make we feel more motivated. A tidy, well-lit space will help me focus and study more effectively. Make sure that area is comfortable, so that you would want to spend time there. </p>
		</li>
		<li><p>
		Comfortable study space may helps to get into work frame of mind faster and avoid distractions to focus on studies.
		</p></li>
		</ul>

		<li><strong>Connect with Other Students</strong></li>
		<ul>
		<li>
		<p>With modern technology and the internet, there are so many ways to connect with people. When live in another town or country, we may not be able to meet people in person, but we can connect online.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
		<p>I will likely be able to connect with other students on my course. with join an online community or create a group on social media where you can all connect to discuss your studies and help each other likes in whatapps or telegram.</p>
		</li>
		<li><p>
		When connect with friend or other classmates it also help us to stay motivated in studies together.
		</p></li>
		</ul>

		<li><strong>Keep to A Routine</strong></li>
		<ul><li>
		<p>Routine is day to day habits. Finding a routine that works for you and sticking to it can help you be successful and get more done in the day.</p>
		</li>
		<li><p>Making studying a regular habit in your daily routine will help you be more successful and reach your goals. Everyday, I will set time for study in my daily routine. 
		</p></li>
		</ul>

		<li><strong>Take Breaks</strong></li>
		<ul>
		<li><p>Studying for long periods of time without taking a break can leave our mind exhausted. Our brain needs to rest. Taking a short break after 90 minutes of studying can help to remain focused.</p></li>
		<li><p>So, it's good to take some break for having some fresh air. Movement is good for the body and can help boost your energy. A change of scenery and environment will also do wonders for my energy levels and reduce stress.</p></li>
		<li><p>Get some to eat or drink is also can be do when take a break. For some people like me, this option will give more energy and refresh before back to studies.</p></li>
		</ul>

		<li><strong>Keep Connected to Lecturer</strong></li>
		<ul>
		<li>
		<p>When we study online it's all about ourself to focus on study but we need to always connect with lecturer. For example, when I don't really understand of what I learn, I may asked lecturer to give more explaination about that.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
		<p>Try to avoid being so shy to ask like our usual class at college, but be more confident to ask them. In addition, lecturer may give more guidence in our learning process.</p>
		</li>
		</ul>
	</ol>
